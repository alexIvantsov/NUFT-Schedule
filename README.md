# NUFT-Schedule
This application is created for NUFT students. It helps to display a lesson schedule  in a friendly format. Install the application, select your group and browse your schedule. In the app you can get the location of your university via Google Maps. Once you downloaded your schedule it would be stored locally and you wouldn't need the I access to use it.
